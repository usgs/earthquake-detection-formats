# Pick Format Specification

## Description

Pick is a format designed to encode the basic information of an unassociated
waveform arrival time pick.  Pick uses the
[JSON standard](http://www.json.org).

## Usage
Pick is intended for use in seismic data messaging between seismic
applications and organizations.

## Glossary

**Required Values:**

These are the values **required** to define a pick.

* Type - A string that identifies this message as a pick.
* ID - A string containing an unique identifier for this pick.
* Site - An object containing the station the pick was made at, see [Site](Site.md).
* Source - An object containing the source of the pick, see [Source](Source.md).
* Time - A string containing the UTC arrival time of the phase that was picked, in the ISO8601 format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ`.

**Optional Values:**

The following are supplementary values that **may or may not** be provided by
various picking algorithms.

* Phase - A string that identifies the seismic phase that was picked.
* Polarity - A string containing the phase polarity; "up" or "down".
* Onset - A string containing the phase onset; "impulsive", "emergent", or "questionable" .
* Picker - A string describing the type of picker; "manual", "raypicker", "filterpicker", "earthworm", or "other".
* Filter - An array of objects containing the filter frequencies when the pick was made, see [Filter](Filter.md).
